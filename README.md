# ES6 Pure Webpack Boilerplate with Jest and ESLint
Built upon https://github.com/metagrover/ES6-boilerplate and adapted to meet my own needs, a pure JS webpack boilerplate
with jest and eslint support.

## Usage
* `npm start` to run eslint on watch mode and dev-server at localhost:8080.
* `npm run watch` to only watch for/recompile on changes.
* `npm run build` to run tests, linting and then build a minified version in build/dist, in that order.
